//! The Rust representation of `air.toml`

//! The names and types of the fields in this struct determine the names and types

//!
//! Every field is optional at this point, nothing is "finalized".
//! Finalization is done in [TomlOptions::into_settings].
//!
//! Global options are specified at top level in the TOML file (though we don't have
//! any of those at the moment). All other options are nested within their own `[table]`.
//!
//! Note that the doc comments in this file directly influence `air.schema.json`, which
//! is generated with `just gen-schema`.

    /// - `file.R` excludes a file named `file.R` located anywhere below `root/`. This is

    ///   technically also match a file named `folder`, so the trailing slash is preferred
    ///   when targeting directories. This is equivalent to `**/folder/`.

    /// - `/folder/` excludes a directory named `folder` (and all of its children) located
    ///   at `root/folder/`.

    ///   in directories under `folder/` are not excluded in this case (such as
    ///   `root/folder/subfolder/file.R`).
